# Partial Invoice Matching


## 📌 Description
The solution uses AI/ML and NLP to match invoices, even with partial or inconsistent data. It assigns confidence scores to uncertain matches and improves accuracy through continuous self-learning from user corrections.

- It automates matching, handles discrepancies, and speeds up reconciliation by reducing manual effort and errors.
- Self-learning improves over time, and the combination of NLP, confidence scoring, and a user-friendly interface ensures high accuracy and scalability.

## 🚀 Features
- AI/ML-powered invoice matching
- Handles partial and inconsistent data
- Confidence scoring for uncertain matches
- Automation to reduce manual effort and errors
- Scalable and user-friendly interface
